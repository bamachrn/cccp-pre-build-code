/*
workitemrepository.go is a mock implementation of models.WorkItemRepository generated with counterfeiter v2. See https://github.com/maxbrunsfeld/counterfeiter to
find out how to (re-)generate such mocks. Since we haven't decided on using counterfeiter, it is not installed as a dependency right now, but needs to be
"go install"-ed. The code generated from counterfeiter contains a compile error (shadowing of a function parameter) that was fixed manually.
